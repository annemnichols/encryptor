Boot Camp Assignment: Create a .txt file encryptor

I was given the assignment to create a file encryptor following the Ruby Encryptor Exercise posted by benegget
(https://gist.github.com/beneggett/6692194). It was a really interesting exercise and I learned a lot from it.
A few extras I added: 
- Ensured that newlines would be preserved in the encrypted/decrypted files
- Allowed input from user for filename to encrypt, as well as a number to rotate the cipher.
